# Currency-Converter
A currency converter created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides users with a simple tool to convert values between different currencies directly within a web browser. The interface typically consists of input fields for the amount to be converted, dropdown menus to select the source and target currencies, and a button to perform the conversion. 

In terms of design, HTML and CSS are utilized to structure and style the user interface, ensuring a clean and intuitive layout. This may involve organizing the elements into sections, applying styles for consistent typography, colors, and spacing, and implementing responsive design principles to ensure usability across various devices and screen sizes.

The functionality of the currency converter is implemented using JavaScript. This involves retrieving exchange rate data either from a third-party API or a predefined dataset, calculating the converted value based on the selected currencies and input amount, and updating the UI to display the result dynamically. Additionally, error handling mechanisms may be included to handle invalid inputs or network errors gracefully.

Upon selecting the source and target currencies and entering the desired amount, users trigger the conversion process by clicking the conversion button. The converter then displays the converted value in real-time, providing users with accurate and up-to-date currency exchange information. Overall, a currency converter created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript offers a user-friendly solution for quickly and conveniently converting currencies within a web browser.
